# yogasyster

Yogasyster is a homepage for a friend that is newly educated as a yoga teacher. My friend had specifications on what links to have in the navbar, what pictures to use and that it should be earthy colors with some red hints. It is a work in progress and I am still adding features and styles to it.

## 👨‍💻 Search engine optimaztion (SEO)

Great SEO is important to increase high quality traffic on the site. It is in both the web page owner and the user interest that the right user finds the right web page, and that the page will reach the right user.

Since the site is for a startup I put some work in to get a high SEO. I put some extra energy on:

- well written description, title and alt tags
- responsiveness
- HTML semantics
- nameing convention on pictures

## 🗄️ Tech stack

The site has frontend and a backend. For the backend I have used Nodemailer to send messages to a mail.

- React (Functional and class components, Hooks, Routes)
- Styled Components
- Flexbox
- Express
- Node.js
- Nodemailer
