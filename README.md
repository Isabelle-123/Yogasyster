# yogasyster

Yogasyster is (was) a homepage for a friend that was a newly educated as a yoga teacher. My friend had specifications on what links to have in the navbar, what pictures to use and that it should be earthy colors with some red hints. 

## 🗄️ Tech stack

The site has frontend (React) and a backend (Node.js). For the backend I also use Nodemailer to send messages to a mail.

- React (Functional and class components, Hooks, Routes, Code Splitting)
