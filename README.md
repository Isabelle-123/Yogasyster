# yogasyster

Yogasyster is a homepage for a customer that is newly educated as a yoga teacher. The customer had specifications on what links to have in the navbar, what pictures to use and that it should be earthy colors with some red hints. When I started to make the site I realized that I needed som sketches for layout which I also added.

The project started as a "hackday" at School of applied technology. I am still adding features and style to it and the site will be ready to deploy in june 2020.

The site has frontend and a backend with Nodemailer. For the backend I have use nodemaile to send emails direct to a existing (fake)mail. When the page launch I will change the email and where to store sensitive data.
